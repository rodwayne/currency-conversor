# Currency Converter Challenge
As the name of the project states, this is a currency converter. This is a challenge proposed by Alura Latam at the end of the ONE program's Java OOP formative stage for Group 6.

The aim of this project is to put on practice all the skills taught in the following courses:
- Creating your first Java app
- Applying OOP
- Working with lists and data collections
- API consumption, file creation and error management

This converter will have the listed features below:
1. Build a client to make Http requests
2. Build a response to fetch data after calling the Exchange Rate API
3. Turn that response into a JSON format
4. Filter the currency needed
5. Convert the currency to another one based on the actual market's value
6. User interaction through the CLI
